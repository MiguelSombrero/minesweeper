# Minesweeper frontend

> You cannot call yourself a programmer, if you haven't implemented minesweeper

Said propably no one ever. Even so, I like minesweeper. And Windows 10 minesweeper is bloated with adds and unnecessary eyecandy. So here is a simple version of the game, without fancy animations.

This repo is for the frontend of the app. Backend code and install instructions can be found from [Minesweeper backend](https://github.com/MiguelSombrero/minesweeper-backend)

## Implementation

Frontend is implemented with React. React-Bootstrap is used for styling. I borrowed icons for Bomb and Flag from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Minesweeper live

This app is running live on Heroku:
(may not stay up forever though)
